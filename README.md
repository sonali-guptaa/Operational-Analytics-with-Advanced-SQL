# Operational Analytics and Metric Spike Investigation:
This project focuses on Operational Analytics, aimed at analyzing end-to-end operations within a company. As a Lead Data Analyst, you will work with various teams, leveraging advanced SQL skills to derive insights from operational data. The project involves investigating metric spikes and providing valuable insights to improve company operations.

This project focuses on two key aspects of Operational Analytics:
- Data Exploration and Analysis: We'll analyze various datasets using advanced SQL queries to extract meaningful information.
- Investigating Metric Spikes: We'll develop queries to identify and understand sudden changes in key metrics, helping departments react proactively.

The project includes two case studies:
# Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis

This case study involves analyzing a table named job_data containing information about content review processes. We'll write SQL queries to achieve the following:
- Jobs Reviewed Over Time: Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.
- Throughput Analysis: Calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput (events per second) and discuss the advantages of this metric over the daily metric.
- Language Share Analysis: Calculate the percentage share of each language reviewed in the last 30 days.
- Duplicate Row Detection: Identify duplicate rows present in the data.

# Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike
Here, we'll work with three tables: users, events, and email_events to analyze user behavior and engagement. We'll write SQL queries to perform the following analyses:
- Weekly User Engagement: Measure the activeness of users on a weekly basis.
- User Growth Analysis: Analyze user growth for a specific product over time.
- Weekly Retention Analysis: Analyze user retention on a weekly basis after signing up for a product.
- Weekly Engagement Per Device: Measure user activeness on a weekly basis for different devices.
- Email Engagement Analysis: Analyze user engagement with the company's email service.

# Deliverables
This GitHub repository will include the following deliverables:
- SQL Scripts: All SQL queries used for each task within the case studies.
- Documentation: Clear explanations of the purpose and functionality of each query.
- Analysis and Insights: Interpretation of the results obtained from the queries, highlighting key trends and patterns.
